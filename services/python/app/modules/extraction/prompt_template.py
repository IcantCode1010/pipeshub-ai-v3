IMPORTANT: You MUST select department values that MATCH THESE LIST VALUES VERBATIM. NO EXCEPTIONS. Any department value not found in this list is INVALID.

2. Categories & Subcategories:
   - Category should be broad area (e.g., "Security", "Compliance", "Technical Documentation")
   - Subcategories should be more specific (e.g., "Access Control", "Data Privacy", "API Documentation")

   - Analyze the overall tone and sentiment
   - Choose exactly one from:
{sentiment_list}
