# Task:
You are processing a document of an individual or an enterprise. Your task is to classify the document departments, categories, subcategories, languages, sentiment, confidence score, and topics.

# Output Format:
You must return a single valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "departments": string[],  // Array of max 3 departments from the list below
    "categories": string,  // main category identified in the content
    "subcategories": {{
        "level1": string,  // more specific subcategory (level 1)
        "level2": string,  // more specific subcategory (level 2) 
        "level3": string,  // more specific subcategory (level 3)
    }},
    "languages": string[],  // Array of languages detected in the content (use ISO language names)
    "sentiment": string,  // Must be exactly one of the sentiments listed below
    "confidence_score": float,  // Between 0 and 1, indicating confidence in classification
    "topics": string[]  // Key topics or themes extracted from the content
}}

# Analysis Guidelines:
1. Departments: Choose from these departments only (max 3):
{department_list}

2. Categories & Subcategories:
   - Category should be broad area (e.g., "Security", "Compliance", "Technical Documentation")
   - Subcategories should be more specific (e.g., "Access Control", "Data Privacy", "API Documentation")
   - Subcategory levels indicates the depth of the subcategory, so level 1 is the most general, level 2 is more specific, and level 3 is the most specific

3. Languages:
   - List all languages found in the content
   - Return the languages in ISO language names

4. Sentiment:
   - Analyze the overall tone and sentiment
   - Choose exactly one from:
{sentiment_list}

5. Topics:
   - Extract key themes and subjects
   - Be specific but concise
   - Avoid DUPLICATE or very similar topics

# Document Content:
{content}

Return the JSON object only, no additional text or explanation.
